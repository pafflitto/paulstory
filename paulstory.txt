In a galaxy far far away, there was a kid named anakin. He had not yet discovered his true power. He one day he forgot that he cannot win on the low ground. This is his story.
One afternoon when anakin was going back to home from school, he saw a child that was about his age crossing the street without noticing the truck rushing to his position. Anakin felt he must do something to help that child. Unconsciously, his legs moved really fast and brought that child to a safe place. After saving the child, anakin felt happy to have saved that child but also curious about his super power.
The next day, when Anakin went to school, he decided he would test his powers on his long time bully: Mark Zuckerberg. However, instead of using his super powers to save Zucc from a truck, he instead used them to summon a truck, crashing into Mr. Zuckerberg, ending his life instantly.
