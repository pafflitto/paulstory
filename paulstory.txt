In a galaxy far far away, there was a kid named anakin. He had not yet discovered his true power. He one day he forgot that he cannot win on the low ground. This is his story.
One afternoon when anakin was going back to home from school, he saw a child that was about his age acrossing the street without noticing the truck rushing to his position. Anakin felt he must do something to help that child. Unconsciously, his legs moved really fast and brought that child to a safe place. After saving the child, anakin felt happy to have saved that child but also curious about his super power.
