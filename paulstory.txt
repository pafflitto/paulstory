In a galaxy far far away, there was a kid named anakin. He had not yet discovered his true power. He one day he forgot that he cannot win on the low ground. This is his story.

One afternoon when anakin was going back to home from school, he saw a child that was about his age crossing the street without noticing the truck rushing to his position. Anakin felt he must do something to help that child. Unconsciously, his legs moved really fast and brought that child to a safe place. After saving the child, anakin felt happy to have saved that child but also curious about his super power.

The next day, when Anakin went to school, he decided he would test his powers on his long time bully: Mark Zuckerberg. However, instead of using his super powers to save Zucc from a truck, he instead used them to summon a truck, crashing into Mr. Zuckerberg, ending his life instantly. 

Now Anakin understood that there were 2 sides to this power he held: the good and the bad side. He really enjoyed the bad side; launching semi trucks at innocent bystanders was a lot of fun. But Anakin also had morals and he knew that killing people with trucks was a mean thing to do. Therefore, Anakin took the high ground and decided to only use his power for good.


Anakin would then be known around the galxy for his heroism. He would grow up and have children, leia and luke. Both also possessed this power and used it for the good of humanity. The Skywalkers were renound around the galxy as heroes for decades.
